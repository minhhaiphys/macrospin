    "\n",
    "The cubic anisotropy can be defined in the context of a given crystal surface. The origins of cubic anisotropy are in spin-orbit coupling [(O'Handley, 2000)](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471155667.html). The cubic anisotropy contributes to the free energy in terms of the square of the magnetization. This can be explained by time-reversal symmetry, under which the direction of magnetization ($\\vec{M} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{J}$) is expected to reverse [(Landau et al., 1960)](https://www.elsevier.com/books/electrodynamics-of-continuous-media/landau/978-0-7506-2634-7). The free energy should not reverse sign since this would make stable equilibriums into unstable energy maxima. The first two terms of the anisotropy part of the free energy take the form\n",
